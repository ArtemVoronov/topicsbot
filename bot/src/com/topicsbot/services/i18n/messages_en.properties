Bot is in the process of learning, and in future it will be able to generate a more exact match of topics.\n\
- You can add your own topics. Limit of topics is 7 per day.\n\
- Don't forget to specify at /settings what language is used at the chat and its time zone. It is necessary for properly bot working.\n\
