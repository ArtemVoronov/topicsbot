build.note = A note to current version:\n\
- Bot can generate topics based on keywords statistics, but these topics may be different from topics that were discussed actually. \
Bot is in the process of learning, and in future it will be able to generate a more exact match of topics.\n\
- You can add your own topics. Limit of topics is 7 per day.\n\
- Don't forget to specify at /settings what language is used at the chat and its time zone. It is necessary for properly bot working.\n\
- Bot is ill by an amnesia and every day forgets everything at midnight.\n\
- Added supporting of inline mode and new command: using /world_topics you can see what has been discussed in Telegram today.\n\
- Added supporting of hashtags.
